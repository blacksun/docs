"Objective PHP is a lightweight framework written in PHP7 with OOP in mind. "
"This is why it's called that - there is other reason, except a pun on "
"Objective C of course :)"

msgid ""
"Is Objective PHP a fullstack framework? Is it a micro-framework? Actually, "
"neither. We use to call it a mini-framework, meaning that it's somewhere in "
"between: it provides the developers with much more than a micro-framework "
"does, but also less than a fullstack."

"Objective PHP aims at handling applicative workflows, then let the developer"
" do their work. No more, no less."

"For higher level components, like Forms generators or ORMs for instance, we "
"thought that it would be more efficient to let developers bring their usual "
"tools in Objective rather than forcing them to use our own alternatives."

msgid "Why?"

msgid ""
"You may ask yourself: why did those guys bothered with another PHP "
"framework? The answer is quite simple: we're bored with spending more times "
"understanding and masterizing the framework itself than with working on the "
"actual applications features."

"On top of that, we thought taht working on a new framework would also be an "
"opportunity to consider performances in a different way. Most frameworks "
"rely on cache to offer decent performances. Well, cache can help. A bit. But"
" once you cached the poor performing components, what more can you do? "
"Nothing."

"The key idea to help developers getting efficient and comfortable with "
